<h1>My Understanding of This Article + My POV of Today’s Internet</h1>

<p>Recently, I had the opportunity to read Journalist Kate Wagner's essay on the evolution of the internet from an open, universal platform to a less savory entity. Wagner articulates the profound shifts that have occurred within the digital landscape, highlighting the complex interplay of technological advancements, corporate interests, and societal dynamics. Wagner's central thesis about the transformation of the internet resonates deeply with contemporary online culture and digital ethics. She adeptly navigates through the historical trajectory of the internet, from its origins rooted in collaboration and information sharing to its current state marked by surveillance capitalism, algorithmic manipulation, and rampant misinformation.</p> 

<p>One of the essay's most compelling aspects is its exploration of the ideological underpinnings that shaped the early internet. Wagner adeptly captures the utopian aspirations of early internet pioneers who envisioned a democratized space where knowledge would be freely accessible, and communities could flourish uninhibited by traditional power structures. However, as Wagner astutely sees, these lofty ideals have been eroded over time, giving way to a digital landscape dominated by tech giants and profit-driven algorithms. Wagner's analysis sheds light on the role of corporate interests in shaping the contemporary internet experience. She convincingly argues that the commercialization of cyberspace has led to the prioritization of engagement metrics over substantive content, resulting in the proliferation of clickbait, sensationalism, and echo chambers. This commodification of attention has not only distorted online discourse but also worsened social divisions and undermined democratic processes. Furthermore, Wagner's critique extends beyond the technological realm to interrogate broader societal dynamics that have contributed to the internet's descent into a less savory entity. She examines issues of inequality, discrimination, and systemic bias that are perpetuated and amplified within digital spaces, calling attention to the urgent need for ethical interventions and regulatory frameworks to safeguard against exploitation and harm.</p> 


<p>To compare Wagner’s experience with the internet to mine, I see what she’s talking about how social media has changed since it’s humble beginnings. I first used social media when I was 10 and I was only really using Facebook and YouTube at the time. I would always look at posts and watch videos of my interest such as childhood youtubers I liked or just random funny videos. As I grew older, the more social apps I use, the more awareness I gained from it and finally, how ads have been basically “taking over” the sites I used to look at all day. For instance, YouTube has had ads during the videos and since 2015, before the video starts. It's gotten worse when YouTube pushed for 2 ads, skippable or not, before the vid starts and they also have pop-up ads about weird stuff from mobile apps to unsure websites. Other Social sites like Twitter or Instagram got ad bots, girls promoting Onlyfans, and People paying Meme Accounts to promote their stuff like sellouts. There’s also a bunch of sites out there pretending to be reliable sources to the point you don’t know who’s right or wrong anymore and this is just the beginning for what I experienced over the years on the internet.</p>

 
<p>In conclusion, I can easily see why Wagner sees the internet as a shell of its former self and glory. Kate Wagner's essay offers a sobering yet insightful analysis of the evolution of the internet and its implications for contemporary society. Even though the popularity and use of the internet is rising every day, there are a lot of negative things about it as well. Her exploration of the tensions between utopian ideals and commercial imperatives provides a good framework for understanding the complexities of digital culture and charting a path forward towards a fairer and more humane online ecosystem.</P>
